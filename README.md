# Pokedex App!

Welcome to my first working Pokedex app! This is a react project built around the PokeAPI V2.

This is a WIP so check back frequently.


## Future Feature: 

- Adding more generations (Currently 1-3)
- Add Filter options
- Create Team option

Thanks for checking this out!

v1.0.1

### Update 19/10/23
- Added NavLinks to filter through API by generation, using a context for setting Offset & Limits
- Bugs: 
    - API content isn't fully working in the later generations - missing names, wrong styles, and therefore not all pokemon will play the screech correctly
    - Still needs styling on NavLinks
